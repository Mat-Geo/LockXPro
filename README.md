About MPV 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ :

Welcome to MyPersonalVault 😇 

This software stores details of your various accounts like URL's, website name, user name and also the main part 'THE PASSWORD'.
Inorder to ensure maximum security, the password manager will be secured by a master-password exclusively known only to the user 
and set according to the user input. The user be given access to the manager using this password and also an OTP sent to the registered
mail id given by the user while creating an account for the first time. The master-password should not be something predictable and it 
should be remembered by you at all times inorder to gain access to the manager. If the master-password is forgotten then you can 
choose forgot password option and an email will be sent to your registered email containing an OTP. After verification you can go reset your master-password.
For now the project is maintained in a simple and basic way. Althought the main code is simple, it contains enhanced cryptographic techniques such as SHA-256 
which is used for hashing and encryption. This provides maximum security to the data stored on the MySQL database.
In near future the software will be further developed with friendly UI's and much more.
